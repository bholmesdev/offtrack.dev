Cry

Kaitlyn Oliveri

Every once in a while, the Spotify algorithm digs up an underground gem. This track won't blow you away with production, but something about it feels... honest. The chorus pops off and the bridge has a great breakdown.

Get Down

Kaah

Bumping house track from a solo Swedish producer. Keep playing until the end; the drum breakdown is such a good payoff.

Not Today

Thee Marloes

Groovy jazz track from an Indonesian Trio. The whole album is perfect background music, but the keyboard on this one stood out to me.

Magdalena Bay

Second track off of Magdalena Bay's upcoming sophomore album. If you missed the debut... you're sleeping on my favorite band. They blend weird Internet culture with catchy synth pop. Other than this track, Killshot is the best intro to the band if you're new to them. It's Britney Spears for Gen-Z... but in a really good way.

Anthem for those who know

Karyyn

Super moving solo performance. The vocals reminded me of Bjork at the climax, and that's saying something.
